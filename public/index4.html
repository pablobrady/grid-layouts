      <p>Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!
      <p>Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!
      <p>We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.
      <p>Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.
      <p>Look at the size of that thing! Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys! Red Leader, this is Gold Leader. I copy, Gold Leader. We're starting for the target shaft now. We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire. Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees. I see it. Stay low. This is Red Five, I'm going in! Luke, pull up! Are you all right? I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
